# LQJ - Liège que j'aime

## Main Idea

What about an interactive discovery of Liège ? 

First thing first I am sure people don't Liège as you should, its specially true for a young fellow...If it's a hometown, they probably totally didn't care about knowing its History. Little bit like Eiffel tower for Parisians, they got used to it, they know it but ... well, they know it. I must also admit that they have to know their History because they have to pass the Baccalaureat which is not our concern ... 

Still, my point is that we get used to Liege... and we think we know it, but we don't.
